		Neo Chung and George Dyer form an experimental audiovisual duo called <em>Time Waves</em>. They recently traveled to South Korea together, where they both experienced the same events and places. One of them recorded visuals, the other recorded sounds. One of them is native to the culture, the other is a complete foreigner. How will these individuals recollect and present their respective experiences?
		</p>

		<p>		
		<em>Seoul Searching</em> aims to explore the discord and similarities between individuals' memories. Even using objective data such as video and sound recordings, the manner in which they piece together these media might tell a vastly different story. Before the performance, Neo and George will separately prepare the material necessary to present improvised collages of their recordings. Neo will juxtapose and blend his video clips ranging from calming paper lanterns in Tongyeong to the career driven streets of Seoul. George will sample his field recordings, producing a library of loops and textures that he can mix together in a live setting. 
		</p>

		<p>		
		The performance will consist of Neo and George creating an improvised audiovisual collage that will sublimate their individual recollections into a cohesive whole. By playing off of each other and exploiting points of tension and release within their respective performances, <em>Seoul Searching</em> will create a unique mosaic that will highlight the stakes of our shared human experience.

		George Dyer is a singer, guitarist, and producer who has performed at Club Nietota, Vertigo Jazz Club, and Stary Klasztor in Wroclaw. For this project, George will be drawing his inspiration from artists such as Biosphere, Carl Craig, Thomas KÃ¶ner, and Pierce Warnecke.
